# Overview
### Backend
- PostgreSQL must be installed and running. Windows 11 64bit PostgreSQL 15 was used for this project.
- Postman is an API (Application Programming Interface) development platform for testing and modifying APIs.
### Frontend
- React deals with a user input field and displaying the value in a table. The user can edit and delete inputs.
- Javascript XLM (JSX) and HTML: At the heart of a website are HTML documents. Your web browser reads these documents and displays them as web pages on the screen of your computer or other electronic devices you use. During this process, browsers create a structure called Document Oriented Model (DOM) about how pages are arranged. Updating the DOM using JSX brings an incredible website performance boost and development efficiency. (see JavaScript XML (JSX) , React Fragments )

### Technologies - Backend
- [PostgreSQL v15](https://www.postgresql.org/) - to manage database
- [Express.js middleware v4](https://expressjs.com/)- to build RESTful APIs with Node.js
- [Node.js v18](https://nodejs.org/en/)- to create the server side
- [Postman API](https://www.postman.com/) to simulate frontend

### Technologies - Frontend
- [React framework v18](https://reactjs.org/) - to create user interfaces
-[ Bootstrap v5](https://getbootstrap.com/) - to improve web page designs

### Pre-Setup
- All necessary components must be downloaded.
- should have a basic knowledge of Javascript and React.
- This will also help you if you have knowledge of how the Restful API (CRUD app) works.
